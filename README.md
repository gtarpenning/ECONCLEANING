# ECONCLEANING

This is a repository for the Nueva Senior Econ Thesis Seminar. Griffin and Daniels project requires lots of data cleaning,
so they made this Github to store their evolving Python code.

The main use of Python was the implementation of Vector Auto-Regression, a tool to effectively regress time-series data.
